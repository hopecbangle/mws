              At the House of Design, I started as an electrical assemble technician.  Through connecting high and low voltage components based on schematics, my exceptional attention to detail became noticed.  Because of that and my hard work, I was promoted in under a year, to a Robotics System Engineer.  As a Robotics System Engineer, I helped increase OEE by programming robot target points to be closer and more precise.  I was also tasked with creating pneumatic drawings that had never been documented previously for customer projects.

              Turn-Key Medical gave me the opportunity to see inside the heath industry by being dispatched to hospitals where I had to troubleshoot and repair mammography machines, CT scanners, and mobile x-ray units based on a customer description of the problem.  I performed periodic maintenance so the equipment could perform at an optimal level without causing patient appointments to be rescheduled.  Documenting the work I performed at a customer site was important so the customer could be billed appropriately, especially when I needed to order parts to replace damaged ones.

              The design work I was able to do at Rogerâ€™s Benefit Group was an exciting time for me.  I used my technical skills to maintain the servers in the office as well as the users and their computers.  I was fortunate enough to assist with logo updating and co-branding for heath insurance carriers on our local website.  I was tasked daily with designing informational emails and broadcasting those emails to more than 250 associates.  I also created documentation for daily procedures for reference and future consistency.
